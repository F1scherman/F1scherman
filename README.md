### Brayden Jonsson (F1scherman)

You can add a readme to your personal profile?!?

I'm currently a student at the University of Utah studying Computer Science, with additional minors in Math and Physics. I am also a TA for CS2420: Data Structures and Algorithms. I use my Github for school and personal projects, although most school stuff is left private at the request of instructors. You can view more information about me at my website, braydenjonsson.dev.
